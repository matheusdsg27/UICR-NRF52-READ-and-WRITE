# UICR-NRF52-READ-and-WRITE
This firmware is designed for the nRF52-DK and demonstrates how to store factory calibration data in the UICR (User Information Configuration Registers). The system utilizes a button press to trigger the write operation, and the stored data can be verified using external tools such as nrfjprog.
